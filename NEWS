* Changes in 0.4

** Features

*** Switching buffers is way less annoying now
Point/mark is better preserved in buffers.  Opening the info and files
buffers simply refresh if they are the same one (torrent id) that was
drawn before.  The transmission-draw and transmission-refresh
functions now do what they're supposed to do.

*** Torrents can now be added by BitTorrent info hash

*** New commands for adding and removing trackers

*** Support for RPC username and password

*** More HTTP errors are caught
401 for bad RPC credentials, and a few others for an incorrect path
to the RPC

** Customization

*** Session address
The RPC path variable `transmission-path' is now named
`transmission-rpc-path'.

*** RPC authorization
New variable `transmission-rpc-auth' allows RPC username and password
to be configured.

** Bug fixes

*** transmission-prop-values-in-region does the right thing now

* Changes in 0.3

** Features

*** New commands for bandwidth priority, reannounce, global seed ratio
limit

*** Leading directory in files list is truncated if possible

*** Added more torrent information to *transmission-info* buffer.
Tracker URLs and tiers, along with peers, seeders, leechers, and
snatches from each are displayed.

Minimal peer information--numbers connected, seeding, leeching--is
displayed.

Torrent pieces are now displayed.  Needs fixing.

** Added a Makefile and README

** Bug fixes

*** Fixed issue with not being able to add .torrent files.

*** Fixed a divide-by-zero bug.

* Changes in 0.2

** Now compatible with stable Emacs 24.4

* Changes in 0.1

** Basic Transmission torrent client. "transmission.el" is an interface
to a Transmission session for GNU Emacs.

Entry points are the `transmission' and `transmission-add' commands.

A variety of commands are available for manipulating torrents.  Some
of them can be applied over multiple torrents simultaneously by
selecting them within a region.

*** Features a torrent list and two other contexts: one for the files
contained in a torrent, the other for detailed information about the
torrent.

One can start/stop, verify, and remove torrents, set global rate
limits, and set individual file priorities.

*** Customization

**** Session address
The variables `transmission-host', `transmission-service', and
`transmission-path' have the default of a local Transmission session.

**** Appearance
The variables `transmission-file-size-units' and
`transmission-time-format' control the appearance of
file-size/bitrates and dates, respectively.

**** Timer
The variables `transmission-timer-p' and `transmission-timer-interval'
control whether the torrent list updates automatically, and at what
period.
